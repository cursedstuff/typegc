## Contributing to typegc

Well I'm really flattered that you're even reading this, even more so if you are actually going to contribute.

I'd like to say a few words about contributing.

-   You should use our prettier formatter config to enforce code style
-   Use TypeScript; JavaScript contributions will be immediately shunned :)
-   Follow the really simple code of conduct we have here
-   Be cool 😎 Peace out ✌️
